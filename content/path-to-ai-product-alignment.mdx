As AI systems become increasingly integrated into products, ensuring their alignment with desired user outcomes is paramount. At Autoblocks, our goal is to tackle this challenge head-on, developing philosophies and approaches that will pave the way for AI product alignment.

The journey to AI product alignment is twofold: first, we must correspond AI development to user outcomes; second, we must make the development process more deterministic, enabling us to understand with greater confidence how changes in the AI system will impact user outcomes.

## AI Development \<--> User Outcomes

Associating AI development with user outcomes is relatively straightforward, thanks to our trace and span model. However, user outcomes are a lagging indicator, providing insight only after the fact. This can be problematic for companies with lower risk thresholds, as they may require more immediate feedback during the development process.

## "Deterministic" Testing

The more significant challenge lies in building confidence during development regarding how changes will affect user outcomes. This is where evaluations and evaluators come into play. Evaluators serve two primary functions: deriving objective measures of quality on subjective outputs and acting as proxies for quality by representing different variables that could ultimately inform it.

At Autoblocks, we focus on helping our customers build accurate classifiers and evaluators, associating them with user outcomes to enable an outcomes-driven approach to AI development. Our goal is not merely to facilitate testing and evaluation for their own sake, but to ground development in real user outcomes.

To achieve this, we provide a first-class workflow for testing, experimentation, and evaluation, help associate evaluations with actual user outcomes, and maintain the accuracy of evaluators over time. Additionally, we ensure that test cases represent real user inputs, as they are essential for making the development process more deterministic.

The path to AI product alignment is not without its challenges, but by focusing on the correspondence between AI development and user outcomes, and by making the development process more deterministic through the use of evaluations and test cases, we believe it is an achievable goal.

At Autoblocks, we are committed to helping our customers navigate this journey, ensuring that their AI systems are aligned with the outcomes their users desire.
